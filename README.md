# Hogwarts, Django Edition
Imagine an alternate universe where Hogwarts decides to adopt 21st century technology, specifically the Django 2.1 framework. These are the results of Hogwarts' tech-leap forward:
* The old Sorting Hat is now thrown into the garbage. 
* Each House is now allowed to have its own distinct courses, but may also share courses with other Houses.
* Students are no longer separated into Houses, but take courses that may come from different Houses
* Hogwarts adopts a virtual "Sorting Hat" to receive survey responses from both students and professors and match them to one another. 

### Technologies Used:
* Crispy Forms
* Bootstrap 4.0
